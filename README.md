# Sos52 - Social Media Project UI (Frontend)

This is the **frontend user interface** for a **social media platform** built using **React** and modern tools like Vite, React Query, and WebSockets for real-time notifications. This project interacts with a backend API app called **sos52-api** to handle data management. It includes essential social media features such as creating posts, managing user profiles, liking posts and comments, following users, and real-time interactions using WebSockets.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey from the book **"Rockstar Developer 2025"**.
